        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I am a Computer Science student at Taif University, deeply passionate about technology and software development. With a strong foundation in Java, I have successfully completed several projects in the language, gaining practical experience in problem-solving and coding efficiency. I am also interested in web development, and I am constantly working to expand my skill set by learning new technologies and frameworks.</p>
    <p>My goal is to become a versatile full-stack developer who can build efficient and scalable solutions. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open-source communities, and continuously challenging myself to learn and grow.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like to explore the outdoors, read tech blogs, and engage in community activities. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate and expand my professional network.</p>
